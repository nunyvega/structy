# Structy Course Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the [Structy](https://www.structy.net/) course, which focuses on mastering algorithms and data structures. Each solution is an exploration and implementation of various concepts taught in the course, from basic data structures like linked lists and trees to more complex algorithms involving graphs and dynamic programming.

## About Structy
